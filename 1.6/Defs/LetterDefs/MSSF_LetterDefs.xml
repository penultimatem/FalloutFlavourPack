                <letterText>Now that enough trust has grown between Postie and Shelby, she begins to recall the last time she saw the platinum chip.\n\nShe explains that three people were present on the day of the robbery - her, a new recruit called Toe Zuckle, and Gaunt, the now de facto leader of the Speaky Blinders.\n\nShe personally assigned Gaunt the task of delivering the chip to their go-between contact, who, in turn, would go on to deliver it to the original contractor. As Gaunt is the only person who met this go-between contact, only he would know the next place to look.</letterText>

                <spawnedLetterText>It was a simple delivery; carry an innocuous poker chip to a Currys in the Northern Capital, an easy trip by all accounts. But something was off, the tracking number was invalid, and you were told by head office to not just leave a red card and dash - this one was signed-for. \n\nEverything then was a blur. You hit the brakes and screech the van to a halt, a group of youths block the road, then only flashes of memory. A flatcap and a Brummie accent, a shovel, your hands filthy. And then a single gunshot... \n\nYou wake up to a robot dragging you out of a grave, stuffing your head with electronics and signals, and patching you up. But the package was gone. And this isn't Evri - time to get that parcel back.</spawnedLetterText>
