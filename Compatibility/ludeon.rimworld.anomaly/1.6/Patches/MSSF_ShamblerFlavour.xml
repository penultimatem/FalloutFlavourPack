After a few days on their feet, ghouls die from metabolic exhaustion. Captured ghouls can't move and thus won't expire.</description>

            <description>A creature that has received a massive dose of radiation and lost all its upper reasoning.\n\nAbout feral ghouls: Feral Ghouls are people which have been mutated from massive doses of radiation. They attack living creatures relentlessly and their immunity to pain makes them difficult to kill. However, the radiation which mutated them severely impacted their survivability, so feral ghouls expire after a few days of movement.\n\nThere are ways to make your own feral ghouls and make yourself invisible to them, so they attack only outsiders.</description>
